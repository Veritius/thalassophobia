# Large creatures
Creatures significantly larger than the player character.

## Lancer Crabs
Lancer crabs are large, carnivorous crustaceans that hunt by impaling their target with a barbed spear connected to a tether, reeling in and crushing their victims with their large, powerful claws. Their strong legs are used to anchor themselves to rock faces during this process, making them virtually immovable. They often stay anchored to the same location while hunting, leading to flora growing on their exoskeleton, making them difficult to detect.

## Chameleon Sharks
Chameleon sharks are large carnivorous fish with unique color-changing skin. While they are unarmored, their skin gives them unparalleled camoflague, and they can easily ambush a lone diver or even a team of divers. They can move very quickly, but their skin tends to be less effective at camouflage when moving at speed. As such, chameleon sharks tend to move slowly towards their target, and once they're close, abandon hiding and attack with force, making them effective ambush predators.
