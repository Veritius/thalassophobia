# Small creatures
Creatures that are significantly smaller than the player character.

## Sludgers
Sludgers are large fish resembling Earth stonefish, and are passive creatures that avoid threats. However, if they're forced to retaliate, they will spray a quickly-thickening liquid into the water, incapacitating the target while the sludger escapes. Sludger goo is corrosive and can damage exosuits and even the diver inside.

## Skitters
Skitters are fast-moving, small invertebrates capable of fast, supercavitating strikes similar to a [mantis shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp). To a submarine, they pose no threat, and the submarine poses no threat to them due to their speed. However, if a submariner leaves the vessel, skitters will try to attack them. While their strikes are relatively weak, especially through an exosuit, enough of them will begin to do serious damage. They are found in small groups in the open ocean, and larger groups near volcanic vents and other life-dense areas.

## Razor Eels
Razor Eels are individually weak, but they form large swarms in which they attack targets as a collective. Razor eels damage structures and hull components when they swim near them, which they do as a swarm as an attack method. A submariner caught outside in a razor eel swarm can quickly be lacerated to death.

## Clownfish
Named for their similar appearance to Earth clownfish, Vetta clownfish are small, agile fish that commonly form large schools. However, unlike their Earth counterparts, Vetta clownfish can explode if they feel their school or nesting area is threatened. They are more commonly found in areas with venting volcanic material, which they use as part of their explosive chemical reaction.

## Hermit Clams
Hermit clams are similar to Earth clams, except that they take over hinged shell-like vessels they find during their development. They are theorised to have first evolved to take over shells from dead clams, later evolving the ability to perform a rapid strike with a proboscis, piercing tissue and injecting a mild paralyzing agent in self-defense. As a result of the human presence on Vetta, hermit clams now take over crates inside abandoned structures, posing a significant occupational hazard to salvagers. They can be identified by iridescent markings surrounding their vessels, which a good submariner will learn to avoid.
