# Medium creatures
Creatures that are more or less the size of the player character.

## Rock Crabs
Rock crabs are heavily armored crustaceans with large, armored limbs and strong feeding mandibles. Rock crabs are usually passive, and ignore submarines unless their feeding grounds or nests are disturbed. Their claws can easily cut a human in half even through an exosuit, and their tough shell resists most small arms fire.

## Python Squids
Python squids are soft-bodied fish that attack by latching onto prey and squeezing the life out of it, most often going for soft, vulnerable parts of the body. If left uninterrupted, they can eventually crack a diver's helmet. However, they can easily be dissuaded with a bit of percussive force. Getting your ally to use a firearm to dislodge a python squid is not recommended.

Yes, these are just underwater Dark Souls mimics. I think they're good design that punishes greediness and encourages a more careful method of exploration, rather than opening every imaginable container for loot. The paralyzing agent should just be a minor inconvenience and not lethal, though.
