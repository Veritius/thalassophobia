# Stunning
Stunning is a mechanic where your character can become incapacitated. There are multiple variations of stuns:
- Full stun (ragdolled and unable to speak)
- Ragdoll stun (ragdolled but still able to speak)
    - Triggered by losing balance
- Immobilisation stun (standing but can't move, able to speak)
    - Triggered by electric shock or the foamgun

## Balance
Balance is a mechanic that ragdoll stuns the player character when environmental effects are overwhelming. When such effects are present, balance is 'depleted'. When depleting effects are not present, balance will quickly recover.

Balance is depleted by:
- Blunt impacts (melee weapons, large shoulder-mounted guns)
- Rushing water (hull breaches, improper airlock cycling)
- Concussive force (grenades, explosions in general)
- Persistent effects (certain status effects)
    - Persistent effects do not affect balance recovery
    - Balance will only recover up to the maximum minus all persistent effects
