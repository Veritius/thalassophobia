# Status Effects
This is a list of status effects.

## Wounds
Explicitly negative status effects.

### Suffocation
The character is deprived of oxygen. Caused by a low oxygen environment, blocked airways, poisoning, or being in the critical state.

### Internal Bleeding

## Special
Status effects with special triggers or other unusual qualities.

### Pain Shock
Severe wounds while still being in the conscious state will cause **pain shock.** This decreases weapon accuracy, movement speed, and interaction speed. Pain shock can be temporarily treated with painkillers, and permanently treated by treating the underlying cause, that being other wounds.

### Irradiated
Having a limb be irradiated slightly multiplies the amount of vitality lost by other wounds, based on the severity of the irradiation status. It also slows the natural healing of wounds, increasing exponentially with severity. Being irradiated also dramatically decreases vitality. This makes radiation a **severe** danger to the player character, requiring intense preparation to survive it.
