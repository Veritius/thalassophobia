# Spearguns
Spearguns are cheap, water-adapted, efficient weapons that simply accelerate a long, barbed metal projectile into the target. They are the earliest weapon available to crewmembers, and their ammunition is cheap and plentiful, being composed of simple metal. They are very inaccurate when fired in the air, but can still do serious damage at close range.

A speargun must be 'drawn' to be fired. As such, there are two kinds of spearguns, manual and electric. Manual spearguns only require spears, but take a long time between shots to draw the weapon. Electric spearguns use power from attached batteries to draw the weapon, and can also be drawn manually without a battery.

Mid-game spearguns also exist as a cheap alternative to [rifles], offering higher damage than other spearguns, with the same cheap ammunition. However, they cannot be drawn manually and require a charged battery to function.
