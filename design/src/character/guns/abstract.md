# Character-held Guns
There are four different kinds of guns that player characters can use. This table is in descending order of the intended progression.

| Weapon Class | Progression | Avg. Capacity | Avg. Damage | Submersible |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [Spearguns]  | Early game  | Very low      | Moderate    | Always      |
| [Pistols]    | Early game  | Medium        | Moderate    | Never       |
| [Shotguns]   | Mid game    | Medium        | High        | Never       |
| [Rifles]     | Mid game    | High          | High        | Sometimes   |
| [Flechettes] | Late game   | High          | High        | Always      |

## Gun Progression
Guns of any tier can be purchased at any time. Progression is instead enforced by the cost of getting the weapons. Spearguns are cheap, so players will purchase them first. Trying to buy a rifle first is not within the budget, since a lot of time will have to be dedicated to generating the funds for the purchase, and since equipment is lost on death, a large investment of funds can be lost through a simple mistake. Later in the game, profits are greater, and this loss is more affordable.

This also creates a tantalising goal for the player. While they can't currently afford the weapon, they know they'll be able to in the future, creating a long-term goal to work towards.
