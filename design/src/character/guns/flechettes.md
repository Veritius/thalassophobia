# Flechette Rifles
Flechette rifles are high-damage, high-capacity submersible rifles. They function similarly to [rifles], except they fire slower in air rather than water. Flechette rifles have significantly longer range than [spearguns] and don't need to be drawn, but their ammunition is expensive. They're a late game solution to underwater combat, outclassing spearguns and rifles.
