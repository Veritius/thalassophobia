# Rifles
Rifles are medium-range, accurate long barrelled firearms. Most rifles function underwater, but have dramatic damage falloff and fire noticeably slower. Specialised ammunition can be used to significantly increase the effective range of the weapon. Rifles have a short-range counterpart, [shotguns], which excel in close-range, dry combat.
