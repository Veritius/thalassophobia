# Pistols
Pistols are small ranged weapons. They do significantly more damage than [spearguns] in air, but most cannot be used underwater. They are the earliest firearm available to the crew, and are most useful for self defense in stations and structures.

## Revolvers
Revolvers are a group of pistols that **can** be used underwater, but have extremely limited capacity for ammunition, a slow fire rate, and suffer from severe damage dropoff in water.

## Flechette Pistols
Flechette pistols are late-game semi-automatic pistols using specialised ammunition. They have very little damage dropoff in water.
