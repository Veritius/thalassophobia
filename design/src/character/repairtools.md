# Repair tools
Tools used to repair parts of the submarine, as part of [maintenance].

## Foamgun
The Foamgun is an early-game tool that quickly seals [hull] breaches, even in the presence of water. Such repairs are **not** permanent, and are significantly weaker than the surrounding hull, only taking 20% of the damage of a real hull piece. Damaged hull can be replaced at outposts.

You can also use the foamgun on living creatures to temporarily [immobilise] them. It's not as effective as dedicated immobilisation or stunning tools, but it's still useful in a pinch if you're an unarmed engineer and you need some time to run from an unexpected visitor.

## Foam Catalyser
A mid to late-game tool that, when applied to foam segments of the hull, makes them significantly stronger. These improved foam segments are 60% as strong as a real hull piece and still need to be repaired at an outpost.
