# Exosuits
Exosuits are special suits that can be worn to protect against the effects of the ocean and the effects of its denizens. Using them is a trade of mobility for protection, and you are given a choice of exosuit, which may offer different balances of the aforementioned trade, and potentially other effects.

In terms of protection, exosuits primarily exist to protect against water pressure. They can be equipped in the event of a hull breach to prevent injury or death.
