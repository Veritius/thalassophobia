# Respawning
Respawning is optional, and can be done at any point after the respawn timer has elapsed. You can go grab a cup of tea while waiting, and your body won't spawn in AFK.

## Respawn stations
Respawn stations are various installations on the submarine that dead players will respawn at. The respawn system takes various measures to ensure you don't spawn in an immediately deadly situation, such as in a flooded compartment or in a compartment filled with monsters. If a suitable compartment cannot be found, you're spawned in the 'least dangerous' compartment with any necessary protective measures, such as an [exosuit].
