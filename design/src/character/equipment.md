# Equipment
"Equipment" is anything that the player can carry on themselves that provides utility or other benefits, like a wrench for performing maintenance, a gun to defend themselves, or an [exosuit] to survive a hull breach.

Unlike [upgrades] which permanently affect the character, equipment is lost on death and must be recovered by the crew. For this reason, equipment should be easily replaceable, or at least easy enough to replace that losing it would not make players feel like they need to load a save. Losing equipment should hurt the crew, but not be the end of the world.
