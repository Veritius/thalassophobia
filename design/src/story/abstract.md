## Summary
On the 5th of June 2066, at the height of the new space programs, humanity became aware of an asteroid roughly 120% the size of Chixulub. It was set to impact with Earth in 22 years, presenting an unstoppable existential threat. To save the species, 12 generation ships were built, sent to various planets that researchers hoped could sustain human life to some degree. You are a descendant of one of those generation ships, 80 years later, on a planet called Vetta.
