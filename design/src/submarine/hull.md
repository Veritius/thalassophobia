# Hull
The hull is the tough, outer shell of the submarine, wrapping around the [structure]. It keeps the air in and the water (and anything in the water) out. Maintaining it is an essential part of submarine upkeep.

## Breaches
When a hull segment is breached, water will rapidly rush in to fill any available compartments. These compartments will gradually have their air content replaced with water, and will eventually rise to lethal pressures once fully filled with water.

Hull breaches can be temporarily sealed with a [foamgun]. Foam-repaired segments are significantly weaker than real hull segments, and can be easily breached again. The crew can repair foam segments at any inhabited outpost. A [foam catalyser] reinforces foam segments to be significantly stronger, but still inferior to normal hull pieces.

Small hull breaches can also be sealed by being plugged with various objects, but only from outside. These plugs will eventually fail after a period of time, allowing water ingress into the submarine. An example of something plugging a breach is the lance from a [lancer crab].
