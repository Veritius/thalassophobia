# Submarine Upgrades
The submarine can be upgraded using a similar system to the [Technology Web](../crew/techweb.md), except in a far more linear fashion. Technology is arranged from bottom to top, where the initial upgrades that are available appear at the bottom, and you can progress further up the tree by unlocking nodes.

Unlike the technology web, nodes being dependent on eachother is encouraged. As long as each node actually does something, the player is still rewarded for unlocking nodes, and certain subtrees can be a longer-term goal to work towards.

Upgrade nodes mostly consist of repeated sequences of nodes that continuously improve the same value, like how tough the hull is. New sequences can branch off (hereby called subtrees) that alter a different, but somewhat related value. Dramatically different subtrees should not depend on other trees (gun firing speed is not related to hull strength).

It's important that the submarine upgrade tree **only affects the submarine,** and not the submariners inside it. Characters have their own progression system distinct from the submarine, and that should be respected. Additionally, there should be no overlap with the Technology Web. Aka, submarine upgrades should not grant blueprints.

The cost of unlocking an upgrade node should primarily be credits, but can also cost resources, like steel. Like the Technology Web, purchasing nodes should only be available when at a station.

## Upgrade list
This is a list of stats that could potentially be modified by submarine upgrades. WIP, subject to change.

- Hull Strength
    - Increases the health of the submarine hull
- Engine Power
    - Increases the maximum force output of engines
- Pumping Speed
    - Increases how fast water can be pumped out of and pumped into compartments
- Battery Capacity
    - Increases the capacity of [batteries] in the [power network]
