# Technology Web
The Technology Web, aka the techweb, is a system that is used to purchase [blueprints], consisting of a collection of nodes (blueprints in the tree) radiating from the center point of the tree. The further out you go from the center, the more exotic and expensive blueprints may be.

The techweb is divided into "disciplines" which is used to organise the collections of nodes. Disciplines can be things such as "manufacturing" or "weaponry". Disciplines are for organisational purposes only, and do not affect the accessibility of nodes.

The techweb can be viewed at any time, but purchasing items on it is a service only available at a station. Individual nodes or sections of the techweb may be unavailable for purchase, or have their prices altered, based on the vendor's opinion of the crew. A distrustful vendor will make weapon recipes more expensive, or outright not sell them to the crew.

Nodes in the techweb should become more available in clusters as the game progresses, to prevent the issue of [overchoice] and to ease the design of balance and progression. Ideally, there should be an always-present, 'moving frontier' of unpurchased, but unlockable nodes, in front of unlocked nodes, and behind nodes that are not yet accessible.

**TODO: How the 'moving frontier' can be implemented.**
