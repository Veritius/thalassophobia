# Crew Communication
Communication is essential to a well-performing crew.

## Voice Chat
Players can use voice chat to communicate. By default, they are only audible in proximity to other players. Their voice is also vulnerable to environmental effects, like being harder to hear over a distance.

Players can use a radio headset to communicate over long distances. This radio is vulnerable to interference and signal loss.
