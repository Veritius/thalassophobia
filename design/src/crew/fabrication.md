# Fabrication
The 'fabrication' system is a crafting system.

## Blueprints
To craft something, the crew first requires a blueprint. Once a blueprint is obtained, it'll appear in the menu of any fabricators that can produce it. A blueprint may make multiple products as output, and multiple blueprints may make the same product.

Blueprints are a fine-grained balancing measure that can be used to control when, how, and in what quantity, the crew can make a given product. Once the crew is given a blueprint, it usually cannot be revoked (except for licenses, see below), so controlling how and when it can be obtained is a significant balancing decision. The components the blueprint requires to produce the product is also a valuable way to tweak balance.

### Blueprint Licenses
Blueprints can also be 'licensed', only allowing them to be used a certain number of times. This can be used to restrict the supply of incredibly valuable blueprints. For example, a blueprint for an [implant][implants] may need to be restricted because of how powerful it is.

## Components
The components are the necessary items that must be put into a fabricator to make a product, as per a blueprint. Components themselves may also be a product, and act as an intermediate product between the end result and the beginning raw components.

Components are a balancing measure that vary in how finely they can adjust balance. An incredibly common component like steel being made rarer would affect a wide variety of recipes, but an ultra-rare resource that only a few blueprints use being made more common would affect fewer blueprints.

## Fabricators
Fabricators are dedicated crafting stations.

Fabricators are a coarse balancing measure that can be used to control a portion of how a crew is able to produce products, by changing the accessibility of the fabricator itself. For example, blueprints that can produce various bullets could be restricted to a dedicated ammunition fabricator. By changing the availability of ammunition fabricators, the availability of bullets is also altered. Another example is a fabricator that can produce [implants] can be made available only in the late game, which can be used as part of progression.

## Products
The product is the end output of a blueprint. This can be anything, really.

The rarity of a product has a strong correlation with the blueprints that can produce it.
