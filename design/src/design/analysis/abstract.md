# Analysis
This section seeks to both ask and answer the following question: **What have other games done, and what can we learn from them?** This is done through a critical lens, but also through the lens of how various design choices from other products can benefit Thalassophobia, following [the core design tenets](../goals.md) of the game.

The following pages of analysis are available.
- [Barotrauma](./barotrauma.md)
- [Miscellaneous games](./miscellaneous.md)

These games are yet to have an analysis page written, probably because I haven't played the games yet, but are of interest because of their genre or other traits. Attached are also points of interest for those games.
