# Guidelines: Transport Missions
Transport missions are very common in games. They're about getting things from A to B. The problem with transport missions in a large portion of their iterations is that they're incredibly boring. Playing as a space trucker is not challenging, and there is very little skill involved beyond simply knowing how to steer your vessel.

The problem with transport missions is **risk.** You've probably heard the phrase "risk and reward", and that's very appropriate here. Transport missions reward you with a usually insignificant sum, for little to no resource investment and risk. The solution here is simple: make missions risky, and make them require skill and thought to succeed in.

## Potential solutions
### Dangerous cargo
One approach to add risk is to make the cargo itself risky. Maybe it spoils when exposed to heat, has some kind of timer, or explodes in the presence of water, all of which fail the mission. This requires the crew to be more careful and thoughtful about how they will carry out the mission. The risk here is that of failure - ruined cargo will not get you any money, and cargo that ends up exploding can hurt crew and require a costly repair.

### Sought-after cargo
Another approach to add risk is not to make the cargo itself risky, but to make having it risky. Maybe you're moving illegal drugs through someone's territory, or valuable cargo through a passage known to be frequented by pirates. The risk here is that posed towards the crew - getting caught with drugs will net you a hefty fine, and attracting the attention of pirates might lead to your vessel sinking.

### The long haul
Finally, you can introduce risk simply through resource expenditure. Maybe you have to haul very heavy cargo through a long passage, straining your fuel supplies. Such a long trip means you're more likely to be attacked over the course of it, so maybe you need to carry extra ammo. Here, the risk is that of being unprofitable.

## Where skill comes in
How about taking multiple transport missions with otherwise conflicting conditions? Maybe you're carrying motion sensitive explosives and a time-sensitive package - just go really fast and don't hit a wall, obviously. This is where skill comes into transport missions. Players confident enough in their skills can tip the scales, increasing the risk and subsequently their reward. Sure, impacting a cave wall at the highest speed your submarine can go will cause some structural damage, but if you're good enough to not impact in the first place, you can profit way more.

While transport missions are usually considered to be an easy starter mission to scrape up some quick funds, allowing skill to influence how profitable they can be is a great way to keep them viable all the way into the late game. Plus, experienced players can do starter transport missions faster, kick-starting their campaigns with less of a grind.
