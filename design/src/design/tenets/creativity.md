# Reward creativity and experimentation
The key to encouraging creativity is **giving the players the tools they need to complete a task, and letting them figure it out.** This is the beating heart of an immersive sim - there's multiple approaches to the same problem, and you know you've done it right when there are solutions available you didn't even think of.

There is a fault to this, though: [humans will figure out the optimal solution][tenet-trust-incorrect]. This can be addressed by making it so every encounter is a little bit different, and allowing the player to formulate a new plan of attack. But, of course, that's irrelevant if the optimal strategy is always "fireball", and at that point it's just plain old game balance.

## Keeping the rules the same
The player's ability to be creative is predicated on their trust in the game's rules staying the same. As they play the game, they build an understanding of how the game's world works. Even if your game is generic as can be, the player still has to discover the rules before committing to any actions. This is the root cause of the immortal "does this game have fall damage?" question.

If early in the game, the player is shown or otherwise learns that there is **not** fall damage, then their future plans will take this into account. Later in the game, they might try to jump off from a high-up ledge to flank their enemies. If fall damage is suddenly enabled without them knowing, they'll die, and they'll be frustrated. But more than that, subconsciously, they're less likely to experiment and try new things, and will instead stick to safe methods they're very confident in.
