# Trust the player

## ..to be able to play the game
It's okay to have a hard game. It's okay to use design language to hint to the player as to what they should do. It's *not* okay to outright tell the player what to do at every possible moment. At worst, you're just mocking the player's intelligence, and it doesn't feel good. The player should be able to discover things for themselves, with the imperceptible, guiding hand of game design helping them out.

Handholding can be things like objective markers telling you what to do at every possible moment. Walk here, now walk here, now walk here, now climb this ledge, now walk here. Let players make their own path and discover things for themselves. This is not the guiding hand of game design, this is the hand of the developer grabbing you by the hand and dragging you through the "intended experience" - which sucks!

Have confidence in the player. Give them the tools to complete an objective and trust them to figure it out. If they can't, that's a design flaw, not a player issue, and this is what playtesting should detect.

## ..but not to play the game correctly
You should trust the player to play the game, but not to play it *correctly* - because they won't. Humans are natural optimisers, and if there's a meta to exploit, they'll find it, and they'll use it. If you can cast 'fireball' and solve every encounter with it, then they'll do just that, and they won't have fun.
