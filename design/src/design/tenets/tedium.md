# Minimising tedium
## A hypothetical
Imagine a radio headset. This headset lets players communicate over long distances, or even just across the submarine. This headset is invaluable for teamwork and communication, and it allows fast responses to emergencies. This is useful.

Now, you keep that exact functionality, but you make it require a battery. This battery slowly drains at all times, and must be occasionally replaced every 10-20 minutes. The goal of this choice is to add some more mechanical depth to diving missions - you now have the choice of spending more inventory space on batteries to extend the duration of your radio, allowing longer diving missions, or using minimal batteries and having to rush.

The problem with this design is the players on the submarine. Even if they're doing absolutely nothing, they still have to occasionally exchange the batteries. This is tedium: in this case, it doesn't benefit the experience, instead, it actively detracts from it, albeit in a minor way. But tedium like this builds up and does affect the gameplay experience, and it should be avoided.

A potential solution to this problem is just making batteries recharge when they're on a powered submarine. Dive teams still have to manage their batteries, but crewmembers on the submarine that aren't doing anything are not inconvenienced.

Actually, this isn't a hypothetical. Vanilla Barotrauma's radios do not require batteries, but the [Barotraumatic] mod adds a power requirement to them. This makes extended dives more engaging, but simply lounging around on the submarine becomes slightly more irritating. You can see this for yourself in a real game.

## Why bother?
The purpose of minimising tedium is so players spend more time doing what they play the game for, and less time thinking about things that are not that. If you want to have to micromanage a bunch of tiny things, there are games that provide that exact experience - but this is not one of them.
